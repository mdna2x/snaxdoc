# FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS


### When can I start to mint?
All NFTs will be ready to mint as soon as they are listed. The official launch date will be announced June 1, 2024.

### What happened to my highlight?
If your code is inactive, it is because your link is in a Hot or Finked state.

* Hot means your post is at risk for auto-detection and needs to cool down for a while.
* Finked means your post has been removed by a troll.

### What can I do about trollz?
Celebrate! 

Trollz are annoying little rats that like to report our delicious treats to their leader in hopes of stealing their magic. Luckily, finked posts are restored by placeholders indicating their removal date and value at the time of expulsion. The corresponding Snack will then be considered a rare collectible and a token of authenticity will be distributed to all wallets holding the item. An authenticity token can be sold separately or alongside its ZVZ affiliate.
